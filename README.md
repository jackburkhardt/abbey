# Abbey
This is a map for a Fallout 2 mod I made and never finished. More info on the mod can be found at https://jackburkhardt.com/projects/abbey/

I may finish it at some point in the future, but for now it lays here. You can download it over in the releases: https://github.com/jackburkhardt/abbey/releases/

# Installation
This map uses assets in the base game and should not require any additional mods to run. I believe these files should be all you need, but please let me know if more is needed. I do not have an installation script or a way to link the map to the main game made, so that is on the user to make. The fastest way to get started is to toss them in your maps folder and open it using BIS Mapper or from the load options in the main game. Enjoy!
