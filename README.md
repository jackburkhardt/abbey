# Abbey
This is a map for a Fallout 2 mod I made and never finished. More info on the mod can be found at https://jackburkhardt.com/projects/abbey/

I may finish it at some point in the future, but for now it lays here.

# Installation
This map uses assets in the base game. I believe these files should be all you need, but please let me know if more is needed. I do not have an installation script or a way to link the map to the main game made, so that is on the user to make. Enjoy!
